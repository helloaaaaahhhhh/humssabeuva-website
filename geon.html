<b><h2>Introduction</h2></b> 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhen plants and animals die, their remains are sometimes preserved as fossils in the Earth's rock record. Fossils can reveal information about how plants and animals lived in the past, such as how they looked, what they ate, what environments they lived in, and how they evolved and became extinct. For hundreds of millions of years, the majority of the clues left behind in Earth's fossil record were the remains of organisms (as well as tracks, trails, and burrows - known as trace fossils).


A new type of clue appeared in the rock layers of eastern Africa about 3 million years ago: objects made by our hominin ancestors. Hominins began to live their lives differently, using stone tools in their daily activities. Sharp stone tools made it easier for hominins to cut wood and strip meat from bones.


Other tools could have aided them in their foraging for plant foods or in hunting and killing animals. Tool marks on bones can also be preserved. Human behavior can be traced back to tools and butchery-marked bones, which are also important in the study of human evolution. These artifacts comprise the earliest archeological record, which is used in conjunction with the fossil record to piece together hominin life and evolution. While the fossil and archeological record is extensive, the process of preserving ancient remains can only take place under very specific conditions. The scientific search for more ancient remains continues as the record is incomplete.

<b><h2>Relative dating</h2></b> 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSome archeological and fossil sites lack the materials required for the most precise absolute dating methods (discussed later). Scientists use relative dating methods to estimate the age of objects found at these sites. The ability to determine whether something is older or younger than another is known as relative dating. Relative dating methods are based on fundamental geological principles that govern how rock layers form on the Earth's surface.


Sedimentary rocks are composed of tiny particles that are transported by natural agents (such as wind and water) and laid down in different environments, layer by layer. Each layer is referred to as a stratum, and multiple layers stacked on top of one another are referred to as strata. The study of these layers to reconstruct the sequence of certain aspects of ancient landscapes and environments over time is known as stratigraphy. Nicolaus Steno, a scientist, proposed a set of "Principles of Stratigraphy" in 1669, which are fundamental to all relative dating techniques. These principles are critical in determining the order in which strata formed. The basis of relative dating is determining this order and where artifacts and fossils occur within it.


<b><h3>Stratigraphy</h3></b>
1. The Superposition Principle states that strata at the bottom of a sedimentary sequence are older and were deposited before any strata on top of them. Scientists can label layers from oldest to youngest using this sequence. The age of fossils and artifacts discovered in those layers can then be determined.

2. Layers of sedimentary rock were initially deposited horizontally - parallel to the ground. Strongly tilted rocks did not originate in this manner. They were influenced by geological processes that took place after the layers were formed. Identifying tilted and folded rocks helps scientists put events in chronological order.

3. The Cross Cutting Relationship Principle states that sedimentary layers that cut across other layers are younger than the layers that are cut. This observation aids scientists in identifying gaps in the sequence of events and placing them in the correct order.

<b><h2>Radiometric dating</h2></b> 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMethods of relative dating provide "older-to-younger" sequences or approximate age brackets. Absolute dating methods use years to estimate a specific chronological age. These ages are subject to margins of error, which are statistics that express the degree of precision of the estimate. The margins of error for all absolute dating methods vary depending on the method used and factors associated with the material dated. If the appropriate materials are available for dating, absolute dating methods are the first choice for geologic dating. These methods work with specific geologic materials and can provide direct age measurements of fossils, archeological remains, or the layers associated with these discoveries.


Protons, neutrons, and electrons are the three basic building blocks of an atom. Protons and neutrons constitute the majority of the atom's mass (found in the nucleus), while electrons orbit the nucleus. The number of protons is constant for each element in the periodic table, but the number of neutrons and electrons can vary. Isotopes are chemical elemental variants. Each variant contains the same number of protons but differs in the number of neutrons. The sum of protons and neutrons within an atom identifies each isotope. Carbon, for example, has six protons but six, seven, or eight neutrons. Carbon is made up of three isotopes: carbon-12 (12C), carbon-13 (13C), and carbon-14 (14C) (14C).


The majority of isotopes found on Earth are stable, which means that their protons and neutrons do not change with time or environmental conditions. Some isotopes, on the other hand, have a radioactive nucleus and are unstable. An unstable isotope of an element is converted to a stable isotope by radioactive decay. The unstable isotope emits energy spontaneously through radiation, which changes the number of protons, neutrons, or both. The parent isotope is the atomic nucleus that decays, and the product of the decay is the daughter isotope.


The ratio of parent and daughter isotopes in a radioactive sample is measured for radiometric dating. Organic matter (such as wood, bones, and shells) or minerals and geologic material containing radioactive isotopes must be used for these samples. Many radioactive isotopes' decay rates have been measured; neither heat, pressure, gravity, nor other variables affect the rate of decay.

The quarter of radioactive decay is measured. A half-life is the time required for half of a parent isotope to decay into daughter isotopes. One half-life has occurred when the quantities of the parent and daughter isotopes are equal. If an isotope's half-life is known, the amount of parent and daughter isotopes can be measured, and the time since radioactive decay began can be calculated. Because of differences in half-life length, different elements' isotopes are useful for different age ranges.

 <b> <h2>Summary</h2></b>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Dating methods are a cornerstone of studying the past, and they are a good example of how different types of science work together, such as geology, chemistry, physics, and statistics. Developing and refining dating methods has been a critical component of human evolution research, providing numerous insights into the timeline of our past. Dating methods have assisted scientists in understanding the sites and events relevant to human evolution, from the most ancient of our relatives to historical innovations of our own species.
